<p><strong>Co-locating Facilities</strong></p>

<p>This table provides a guideline for which ICS Facilities are more typically co-located at an incident, and which are not. For example, Camps may be more typically co-located with Staging Areas, the Base, and Helispots, but not normally with the Incident Command Post or Helibases. These are just guidelines. Ultimately, the unique needs of each incident will influence which facilities are co-located or not.</p>
