<p>The only position required to be filled is that of the Incident Commander, or IC.</p>

<p>The individual designated as the IC has responsibility for all functions. The person may elect to perform all functions, or delegate authority to perform functions to other people in the organization. Delegation does not, however, relieve the Incident commander from overall responsibility.</p>
