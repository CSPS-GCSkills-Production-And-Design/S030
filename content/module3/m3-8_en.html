<p><strong>6. Incident Action Plan (IAP)</strong></p>

<p>Every incident response must have an IAP that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>specifies incident objectives</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>states activities to be completed</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>specifies timeframe</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Operational Period”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>is verbal or written:&nbsp;Written plans should be used when it is essential that all levels of the ICS organization have a clear understanding of the tactical actions associated with the next operational period.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the IAP is to provide all incident supervisory personnel with direction for actions to be implemented during the operational period and it identifies operational resources and assignments, and may include attachments that provide additional direction.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Action Plans</strong> provide a coherent means of communicating the overall incident objectives in the context of both operational and support activities.</p>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-5"><p>The initial step in the incident action planning process is to develop the incident objectives. The Incident Commander must develop incident objectives within a short timeframe after assuming command. After the incident objectives are clear, strategies and tactics to achieve the objectives can begin to be developed. Some objectives may change over the course of the incident. Some objectives will be achieved and new objectives will be developed. Strategies may also change.</p>
