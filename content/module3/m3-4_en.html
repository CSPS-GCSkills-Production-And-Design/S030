<p><em>The act of</em> <em>directing, ordering or controlling by virtue of explicit statutory, regulatory or delegated authority.</em></p>

<p>Command at an incident is initially established by the highest ranking individual from the authority that first arrives at the scene, and has jurisdiction for the incident. The Incident Commander should have the level of training, experience and expertise to serve in this capacity. It is possible that the Incident Commander may not be the highest ranking officer on scene.</p>

<p>The <strong>Incident Commander</strong> has the authority to assume command.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Command</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The process of moving responsibility for incident command from one Incident Commander to another is called <strong>transfer of command :</strong>&nbsp;<strong> IC â†’ IC</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Transfer of command must include a transfer of command <strong>briefing </strong>which may be verbal, written, or a combination of both.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Occurs when:&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>a more qualified person assumes command</p>
		</li>
		<li>the incident situation changes, resulting in a legal requirement to change command,</li>
		<li>it makes sense. For example, an Incident Management Team takes command of an incident from a local jurisdictional unit due to increased incident complexity,</li>
		<li>there is a normal turnover of personnel.&nbsp;For example, to accommodate work/rest requests.</li>
		<li>the incident response is concluded&nbsp;and responsibility is transferred to the home agency.</li>
	</ul>
