<p><strong>5. Management by objectives</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Incident management is accomplished by setting and managing by objectives</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Objectives are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>based on overall priorities&nbsp;within a specified time period</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>“what” you are going to do</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>specific, measurable and attainable</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Objectives are communicated throughout the entire ICS organization by the Incident Action Plan (IAP)</p>
	</li>

<p>Incident objectives are established based on priorities:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Life Safety, of responders first and others second.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Incident Stabilization, which is the act of establishing Command, setting Objectives, strategies and tactics as well as initiating actions.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Protection of<strong> </strong>Property and/or the Environment, which means ensuring the emergency doesn’t cause more damage or create further property loss, and protecting the environment from further degradation due to the incident. For example, this could include spraying water on buildings that are near to but not yet involved in a fire and ensuring contaminated firefighting water does not run into storm drains.</li>

<p>All levels of a growing ICS organization must have a clear understanding of the functional actions required to manage the incident. Management by objectives is an approach used to communicate functional actions through the entire ICS organization. It can be accomplished through the incident action planning process, which includes the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Understand agency policy and direction. This means knowing limits and constraints. For example, many fire departments do not attempt an offensive interior attack unless there are two members outside that could affect a rescue (2 in-2 out rule). Until enough firefighters are on scene, the initial crew remains in the defensive mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Assess the incident situation. Many agencies have formal processes known sometimes as “Size Up”. These include; what is the problem, what has happened, who or what is affected or involved, how much or how many, number of resources available etc.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Establish the incident objectives. Based on the size up, these are statements of “what” you are going to do, by when.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select appropriate strategy or strategies to achieve objectives. These are Statements of “How” you are going to meet the Objectives, or the methods.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Perform tactical direction, involves applying tactics appropriate to the strategy, assigning the right resources and monitoring their performance.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Provide necessary follow-up, such as changing strategy or tactics, adding or subtracting resources, and ongoing monitoring.</p>
