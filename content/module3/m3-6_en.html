You will note that the Unified Commanders came from the two primary agencies fighting fires. The Operations Section Chief is from BC Forest Service because the primary problem was several large forest fires that threatened homes.</p>

<p>To ensure clear communications and to coordinate firefighting activities, a Deputy Operations Section Chief was assigned from the Office of the Fire Commissioner. This carried on the concept of Unified Command.</p>

<p>The RCMP, in charge of the Evacuation Branch, reported to the Operations Section Chief, who was from BC Forest Service. This was to ensure clear communications as to where the fire was spreading. The RCMP could also have been part of Unified Command.</p>
