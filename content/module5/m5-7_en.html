<p>One of the General Staff functions is the Operations Section Chief. Until Operations is established as a separate Section, the Incident Commander has direct control of tactical resources. The Incident Commander will determine the need for a separate Operations Section at an incident or event. When the Incident Commander activates an Operations Section he or she will assign an individual as the <strong>Operations Section Chief</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Develops and implements strategies and tactics&nbsp;to accomplish the incident objectives set by the Incident Commander</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Normally the person with the greatest technical and tactical expertise in dealing with the problem at hand</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Organizes, assigns and supervises tactical resources&nbsp;field resources</p>

<p>The Operations Section is typically one of the first sections to be assigned to the incident as it directs and coordinates all incident tactical operations. The Operations Section also typically has the most incident resources.</p>

<p>The <strong>Operations Section</strong> will expand or contract based upon the existing and projected needs of the incident.</p>

<p>Unlike the other sections, this section develops from the bottom up starting with single resources that can be organized into task forces and/or strike teams which can be assigned to Divisions and/or Groups. If necessary, Branches can also be implemented to maintain proper span of control. Also, the Operations Section may have Staging Areas and, in some cases, an air organization. Often the most hazardous activities are carried out in the Operations Section, so it is necessary to carefully monitor the number of resources that report to any one supervisor.</p>
